	INTRODUCTION TO THE ALU
	* Definition: The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a core component of the Central Processing Unit (CPU),
	responsible for performing all arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
	and logic operations (NOT, AND, OR).
	
	* "The computer's mathematical brain": This is where all calculations and data comparisions actually
	take place.
	
	* History and Significance:
		- The ALU is a fundamental and indispensable component in modern computing.
		
		- Intel 74181: A historically significant ALU, the first complete ALU integrated on a single chip,
		introduced in the early 1970s, marking a major step in computer miniaturization and performance
		improvement.
		
	* Basic Structure: The ALU is built from logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).

	ARITHMETIC UNIT
	* This unit is responsible for performing mathematical calculations.
	
	* Binary Addition:
		- The most basic operation the ALU performs. More complex operations (subtraction, multiplication,
		division) can be built upon addition.
		
		- Half Adder:
			+ Function: Adds two single binary digits (bits).
			
			+ Inputs: A and B (two bits to be added).
			
			+ Outputs:
				# Sum: The result of the addition.
				
				# Carry: The carry-over to the next bit.
				
			+ Structure: Uses an XOR gate for the sum and AND gate for the carry.
			
		- Full Adder:
			+ Function: Adds three binary digits (A, B, and a carry-in).
			
			+ Inputs: A, B, and Carry-in (Cin).
			
			+ Outputs: Sum and Carry-out (Cout).
			
			+ Structure: Built from two half adders and an OR gate.
			
		- Ripple Carry Adder:
			+ Function: Adds multi-bit binary numbers.
			
			+ How it works: Chains multiple full adders together, with each carry-out feeding the next carry-in.
			
			+ Limitation: Slow speed due to carry propagation from least to most significant bit.
			
		- Overflow:
			+ Definition: Occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to fit in the available 
			number of bits.
			
			+ Impact: Can cause computuational errors or unexpected behavior (e.g., Pac-Man Level 256 bug).
			
		- Carry Lookahead Adder: Used in modern CPUs to improve speed by calculating carry bits in parallel instead
		of sequentially like in ripple carry adders.
		
	* Other Arithmetic Operations:
		- Subtraction: Usually performed by converting into addition with a negative number.
		
		- Multiplication: In simpler processors, done by repeated addition.
		
		- Division: In simpler processors, done by repeated subtraction.
		
		- Modern processors: High-end CPUs often have dedicated circuits for faster multiplication and division.

	LOGIC UNIT
	* This unit performs logic operations and data tests.
	
	* Logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT).
	
	* Number Checks:
		- Check if a number is zero (e.g., using OR gates and a NOT gate).
		
		- Check if a number is negative (by examing the sign bit).
		
		- Check if two numbers are equal (by subtracting and checking if the result is zero).
		
		...

	STRUCTURE AND INTERFACE OF THE ALU
	* Abstraction Symbol: ALUs are often represented as a "V" symbol in block diagrams to hide inner complexity.
	
	* Inputs:
		- Two data inputs.
		
		- Opcode (Operation Code): A set of bits that tells the ALU which operation to perform.
		
	- Outputs:
		- Result: The output of the operation.
		
		- Status Flags: Individual bits indicating special states of the result.
			+ Zero flag: Set if the result is zero.
			
			+ Negative flag: Set if the result is negative (useful for comparisions like A < B by checking 
			A - B).
			
			+ Overflow flag: Set if arithmetic overflow occurs.
			
			+ Carry flag: Set if there's a final carry-out (in addition) or borrow (in subtraction).

	ALU IN THE OVERALL COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE
	* The ALU is a vital part of the CPU.
	
	* Relation to Memory: Data that the ALU processes is usually fetched from memory, and the result is stored back
	into memory.
