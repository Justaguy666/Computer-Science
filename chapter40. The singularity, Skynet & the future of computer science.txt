	THE FUTURE OF COMPUTING AND AI
	* Ubiquitous Computing:
		- In the future, computers will be deeply integrated into all aspects of daily life.
		
		- The will no longer be seperate devices but will appear in:
			+ Kitchen appliances: Smart fridges, automated ovens.
			
			+ Clothing: Wearable tech, sensor-embeded garments.
			
			+ The human body: Medical implants, brain-computer interfaces.
			
		- The goal is to make computers "invisible", operating seamlessly in our environment.
		
	* AI:
		- AI will continue to advance significantly, becoming more intelligent and capable.
		
		- AI isn’t a solution to every problem, but it has the potential to:
			+ Enhance existing technologies: Making current systems smarter and more efficient.
			
			+ Create entirely new product categories: Introducing innovations we haven't yet imagined.
			
	* The Singularity:
		- A theoretical concept referring to a future moment when AI surpasses human intelligence by a wide margin.
		
		- As AI begins to improve itself exponentially, it could lead to irreversible changes in human civilization.
		
		- Potential implications:
			+ Technological unemployment: Many jobs could be fully automated, resulting in major shifts in the labor
			market.
			
			+ Changing human roles: People may need to redefine their purpose in a world where machines are more 
			intelligent.
			
			+ Ethical and control issues: How can we ensure that powerful AI systems act in the best interests of humanity?

	THE IMPACT OF COMPUTING ON SOCIETY AND HUMANITY
	* The Future of Work:
		- Automation will continue to affect various types of jobs.
		
		- The most at-risk jobs are manual and repetitive cognitive tasks that can be standardized.
		
		- However, jobs requiring creativity, complex problem-solving, critical thinking, social and emotional skills
		are less likely to be automated — and may even be enhanced by technology.
		
	* Human-Computer Merging::
		- Futurists imagine a world where humans and computers become more deeply integrated.
		
		- This may include:
			+ Cognitive enhancement: Brain-computer interfaces could allow humans to access information and process data
			at incredible speeds.
			
			+ Physiological augmentation: Artificial limbs or electronic implants to improve health or physical abilities.
			
			+ Cyborgs: The blending of living beings with machines.
			
	* Computers in Space:
		- Computers are expected to play a vital role in space exploration and colonization of other planets.
		
		- Robots and AI can surpass human limitations in durability, resistance to extreme environments, and long 
		operational durations.
		
		- This opens the possibility of humanity expanding its presence beyond Earth.

	CONCLUSION AND CALL TO ACTION
	* The Importance of Computer Science:
		- The series has shown that computer science is a vast, diverse, and deeply influential field that affects
		every aspect of life.
		
		- It’s not just about writing code, but about how we think, solve problems, and interact with the world.
		
	* Call to Action: With the enormous power of technology, understanding and participating in its development is 
	essential to shaping a positive future for humanity.
