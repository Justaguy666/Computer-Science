	INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER VISION AND HOW IMAGES ARE STORED
	* The Importance of Vision:
		- Vision is the most important human sense, providing a vast amount of information about the surrounding 
		world and enabling us to perform countless complex tasks.
		
		- In AI, the goal is to equip computers with similar capabilities.
		
	* What's Computer Vision?
		- A subfield of computer science (and a part of AI).
		
		- Its goal is to enable computers to extract high-level information from digital images and videos.
		
		- This allows computers to "understand" and "interept" visual content, similarly to humans see and comprehend.
		
	* How Digital Images are Stored?
		- Digital images are usually stored as a large grid of pixels.
		
		- Each pixel is small image unit defined by a combination of three primary colors: Red, Green, and Blue - RGB
		values.
		
		- The intensity of each color (typically from 0 to 255) determines the final color of the pixel.

	BASIC TECHNIQUES IN COMPUTER VISION
	* Object Tracking:
		- One of the simplest applications of computer vision is tracking a specific-colored object in an image sequence
		or video.
		
		- Example: Tracking a bright pink ball by searching pixels with matching color values.
		
		- Limitation: This method can be affected by lighting changes, shadows, and similarly colored objects in the 
		environment.
		
	* Edge Detection:
		- To detect features larger than a single pixel (like object outlines), computer vision algorithms must analyze
		small group of pixels.
		
		- Edge detection involves identifying boundaries where there is a shape change in pixel intensity.
		
		- Example: An algorithm can detect vertical edges by calculating the color or intensity differences between pixels
		to the left and right of a point.
		
	* Kernels and Convolution:
		- Kernel (or filter): A small matrix containing numerical values.
		
		- Convolution: A mathematical operation where the kernel is "slid" across small sections of the image (typically 
		3x3 or 5x5 pixels).
		
		- At each position, the pixel values in that region are multiplied by the corresponding values in the kernel,
		then summed to produce a new pixel in an output image (feature map).
		
		- Different kernels can be used to highlight different types of features in the image:
			+ Kernels for detecting horizontal and vertical edges.
			
			+ Kernels for sharpening.
			
			+ Kernels for blurring.

	IMAGE RECOGNITION AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
	* Face Recognition:
		- A more complex application where computers learn to recognize specific facial features (nose, eyes, eyebrows, 
		mouth).
		
		- Viola-Jones Algorithm: Pioneering and influential method using "Haar-like features" for fast face detection in
		images.
		
	* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
		- A type of artificial neural network especialy powerful and efficient for computer vision tasks.
		
		- Unlike predefined kernels, CNNs can automatically learn useful kernels to recognize complex and interesting 
		features in images through training.
		
		- CNN Architecture: Consists of multiple layers, each with a specific role:
			+ Convolutional Layer: Applies learned kernels to extract local features (edges, corners, textures).
			
			+ Pooling Layer: Reduces the size of the feature map, minimizing parameters and increasing robustness to small
			shifts in object location.
			
			+ Fully Connected Layer: Use the extracted features to perform classification or other tasks.
			
		- Hierarchical Feature Learning: Different layers in a CNN can recognize increasingly complex features
			+ Early layers detect basic features (edges, corners).
			
			+ Middle layers learn more complex features (shapes, object parts).
			
			+ Final layers learn to recognize entire objects (e.g., faces, cars, cats).

	APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE OF COMPUTER VISION
	* Diverse Applications:
		- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Converts images of text into editable text.
		
		- Healthcare: Detecting tumors and diagnosing diseases from medical images (X-rays, MRIs).
		
		- Traffic: Monitoring traffic flow, license plate recognition, autonomous driving systems.
		
		- Security: CCTV surveillance, criminal identification.
		
		- Human-Computer Interaction: Tracking key points on the hand or entire body to interept gestures and body 
		language.
		
		- Augmented Reality (AR): Overlaying digital information onto the real world.
		
	* Smart Interaction:
		- A computer's ability to recognize context - including physical and social environments - enables it to adjust 
		its behavior intelligently.
		
		- Example: Offering help when the user seems confused or avoiding updates when the user is feeling upset.
		
	* Biometrics:
		- Facial structure data (like the distance between the eyes or forehead height) is a form of biometric data.

		- Enables computers to recognize users for unlocking smartphones, verifying identity, or surveillance.
		
	* The Future of Computer Vision:
		- Rapidly advancing due to progress in hardware (powerful GPUs) and algorithms (CNNs, Deep Learning).
		
		- Computers' ability to "see" and "understand" the visual world like humans will fundamentally change how we 
		interact with technology, opening up new possibilities across all fields.
