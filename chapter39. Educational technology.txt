	THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION
	* The Explosion of Information and Technology:
		- The rapid advancement of computer technology has created and distributed a massive amount of global information
		(billions of websites, videos watched daily).
		
		- Although information is readily available, effective learning still requires interaction and hands-on
		experience.
		
	* History of Technology in Education:
		- Technology has supported education for millennia, from cave paintings, writing, and printed books to 
		correspondence.
		
		- Radio and television: Once expected to revolutionize and even replace schools, this did not materialized.
		They remain supportive tools but cannot replace comprehensive learning experiences.
		
	* Tips for Effective Learning from Educational Videos:
		- Adjust video playback speed: Match your information processing pace.
		
		- Pause to reflect: Ask questions, summerize content, or relate it to prior knowledge. This reinforces understanding.
		
		- Practice examples/exercises: Apply knowledge immediately to shift from passive to active learning.
		
	* Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs):
		- A modern form of delivering high-quality education via videos and online platforms.
		
		- Initially expected to revolutionize higher education by offering free knowledge to millions.
		
		- Challenges: MOOCs face major issues at scale, especially in providing timely and personalized feedback to millions 
		of students and have low completion rates.

	EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS (ITS)
	* Educational Technology (EdTech):
		- Computer scientists are tackling challenges in MOOCs and education in general, especially issues of feedback
		and personalization.
		
		- Peer Feedback: Students can provide feedback to one another, supported by algorithms that create small groups
		and automated grading systems.
		
	* Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs):
		- Use AI to provide personalized learning experiences, simulating the role of a private tutor.
		
		- ITS adapts content, pace, and teaching methods based on each learner's progress and needs.
		
	* Core models of ITS:
		- Domain Model:
			+ Represents the knowledge and skills to be learned in a specific subject.
			
			+ Includes production rules for problem-solving and common error rules to handle frequent student mistakes.
			
			+ helps ITS understand knowledge structures and how students might go wrong.
			
		- Student Model:
			+ ITS maintains a personalized model to track what the student knows, needs improvement on, and common mistakes.
			
			+ Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT): A popular technique to estimate a student's knowledge based on their answer.
			BKT considers:
				# Probality of guessing.
				
				# Probality of slipping (careless errors).
				
				# Probality of learning a new skill over time.
				
			+ BKT enables ITS to make more accurate assessments, even when answers are corrected by guessing or wrong due
			to carelessness.
			
		- Pedagogical Model: Determines when and how ITS should interact with the student (e.g., when to give hints, 
		detailed explanations, or move on to the next exercise).
		
		- Adaptive Sequencing: ITS supports mastery learning by choosing the best problems to represent at the right time, 
		ensuring the student masters one skill before progressing to the next.

	THE FUTURE OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
	* Educational Data Mining (EDM):
		- Collects and analyzes data from millions of learners (from MOOCs, ITS, etc.) to discover:
			+ Common student mistakes.
			
			+ How students interact with materials and systems.
			
			+ Predictive factors for academic success or failure.
			
		- EDM improves course design, tutoring algorithms, and instructional interventions.
		
	* Pedagogical Agents: Virtual characters in learning environments that can built trust and relationships with learners, 
	offering social and emotional support.
	
	* New Learning Interfaces:
		- EdTech is evolving toward large interactive surfaces (e.g., smartboards), mobile devices, Virtual Reality (VR),
		and Augmented Reality (AR).
		
		- These create immersive, interactive, and intuitive learning experiences (e.g., exploring the human body in VR, 
		learning history via AR).
		
	* Brain-to-Brain Learning:
		- A futuristic concept where new skills and knowledge could be "uploaded" directly into brain, making educational
		interfaces obsolete.
		
		- Still science fiction, but it reflects a long-term vision of deep integration between technology and learning.
