	INTRODUCTION TO THE BINARY SYSTEM
	* Why Binary?
		- Computers operate using electrical signals, which can be easily represented by two states: 
		Electric current (1) and no current (0).
		
		- The binary system (which uses only the digit 0 and 1) fits this operational model.
		
	* Similar to the Decimal System:
		- We are familiar with the decimal system (10 digits: 0-9).
		
		- The binary system is similar, but only uses 0 and 1.
		
	REPRESENTING NUMBERS IN BINARY
	* Converting Decimal to Binary:
		- Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2 (from right to left: 2⁰, 2¹, ...).
		
		- Example:
			The binary number 1011 equals (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
			
	* Binary Addition: Similar to decimal addition, but when the sum exceeds 1, we "carry 1" to the next 
	left column.
	
	* Range of Representation:
		- An 8-bit binary number (1 byte) can represent 256 different value (0-255).
		
		- The more bits, the wider the range of values.
		
	* Data Units:
		- Bit: The smallest unit (0 or 1).
		
		- Byte: 8 bits.
		
		- Kilobyte (KB): 1024 bytes (commonly rounded to 1000 bytes).
		
		- Megabyte (MB): 1 million bytes.
		
		- Gigabyte (GB): 1 billion bytes.
		
		- Terabyte (TB): 1 trillion bytes.
		
	* 32-bit and 64-bit Systems:
		- Modern computers often use 32-bit or 64-bit systems, allowing them to process larger numbers.
		
		- Example: A 32-bit system can represent numbers up to approximately 4.3 billion.
		
	* Representing Negative Numbers: The first bit is often used to represent the sign (0: positive; 
	1: negative).
	
	* Floating-point Numbers:
		- Used to represent real numbers.
		
		- According to the IEEE 754 standard, these numbers are stored in a format similar to scientific 
		notation (matissa and exponent).
		
	REPRESENTING CHARACTERS (TEXT) IN COMPUTERS
	* Character Encoding: The computer assigns a numerical code to each character (letters, digits, 
	punctuation, etc.).
	
	* ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):
		- A 7-bit code (later extended to 8-bit), representing 128 (or 256) characters.
		
		- Sufficient for English, but limited for other languages.
		
	* Unicode:
		- A 16-bit (commonly used) encoding system that can represent characters from nearly every language
		in the world.
		
		- Solves the compatibility issues between different character sets.
		
	EVERYTHING IS BINARY
	* Images, sounds, videos, software, etc., are all stored and processed as sequences of 0s and 1s.
	
	* This is how computers "understand" all forms of data.
	
	CONCLUSION
	* The binary system is the foundation of all computer operations.
	
	* Understanding how numbers and text are represented help us grasp how computers work at a deeper level.
