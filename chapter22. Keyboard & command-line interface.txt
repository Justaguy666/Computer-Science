	EARLY INPUT/OUTPUT
	* Initial Methods: Early computers used physical controls like gears and switches for input and output.
	
	* Punched Cards and Magnetic Tape:
		- Later, punched cards and magnetic tape became common for storing programs and data.
		
		- Output was provided through paper printouts and indicator lights.
		
	* Computer-Centric Design: These early systems were designed for the convinience of the computer, not the
	user.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	THE SHIFT TO INTERACTIVE COMPUTING
	* Interactivity: In the late 1950s, smaller and more affordable computers, as well as faster and more powerful
	mainframes, led to interactive computing - users could now exchange input and output with the machine in real time.
	
	* Demand for New Input Methods: This shift required new ways for users to input data.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	THE RISE OF THE KEYBOARD
	* Primary Input Device: The keyboard, borrowed from the typewriter, became a major input device.
	
	* History of the QWERTY Layout:
		- Christopher Latham Sholes: Invented the modern typewriter in 1868 and created the QWERTY layout.
		
		- Switching Costs: Although other layouts were proposed, QWERTY remained due to "switching costs" - people
		didn't want to relearn typing.
		
	* Speed Improvements: The development of ten-finger typing techniques significantly improve input speed.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	TELETYPE MACHINES AND COMMAND-LINE INTERFACES (CLI)
	* Adapting the Teletype: Early computer interfaces adapted the Teletype - a mechanical typewriter used
	for telegraphy.
	
	* Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs):
		- This led to the development of the CLI, where users typed commands, pressed enter, and the computer
		responded with text.
		
		- Dominance: This was the primary interaction method until the 1980s.
		
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	THE SHIFT TO DISPLAYS
	* Early Displays: Although screens emerged in the 1950s, they were initially expensive and had low resolution.
	
	* Screen-Based Terminals:
		- By the 1970s, advances made screen-based terminals economically viable, replacing electromechanical 
		Teletypes.
		
		- Emulation: Early screen interfaces often simply emulated the text-based Teletype protocol.
		
	* Text-Based Games:
		- Despite the limitations of text-only interaction, programmers created immersive text adventure games
		like "Zork" (originally "Adventure" or "Colossal Cave Adcenture").
		
		- These games relied heavily on the player's information.
		
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	THE ONGOING RELEVANCE OF THE CLI
	* Power and Relevance: Through simple, the CLI remains powerful and relevant - especially for programmers 
	and remote system access.
	
	* CLI in Modern OSes: Modern OSes still include CLIs.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	LOOKING AHEAD: while the keyboard and CLI are foundational, computers have so far lacked graphics.
