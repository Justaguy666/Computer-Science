	EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION
	* Alan Turing (1912-1954): Born in London in 1912.
	
	* Talent: Demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for mathematics and science from a young age.

	THE DECISION PROBLEM AND THE TURING MACHINE
	* The Decision Problem (Entscheidungsproblem):
		- Context: In 1935, while studying at King's College, Cambridge, Turing tackled a challenge posed by
		German mathemacian David Hilbert.
		
		- Content: The problem asked whether a general algorithm exists that can determine the truth or falsity
		of any logical statement.
		
	* The Concept of the Turing Machine:
		- Purpose: To address the Decision problem, Turing conceived of a hypothetical computing device, now
		known as the Turing Machine.
		
		- Components:
			+ An infinite tape to store symbols.
			
			+ A read/write head.
			
			+ A state register.
			
			+ A set of rules governing its actions based on the current state and read symbol.
			
		- Significance: In theory, a Turing Machine can perform any computation given enough time and memory,
		making it a "universal computer" - the theorical foundation for modern computing.

	THE HALTING PROBLEM
	* The Problem: Turing used his machine concept to tackle the "Halting Problem" - the question of whether
	a program will eventually stop or run forever.
	
	* Result:
		- Turing proved that no general algorithm can solve the Halting Problem for all possible program-input
		pairs; it is "undecidable".
		
		- Significance: This revealed fundamental limits to what computer can solve - a landmark discovery in 
		computer science.
		
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	WORLD WAR II AND THE ENIGMA MACHINE
	* Bletchley Park: During WWII, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, the UK's code-breaking center.
	
	* Cracking Enigma:
		- He played a key role in breaking the German military code encrypted by the Enigma machine.
		
		- Enigma Machine: Used rotors and a plugboard to generate billions of possible encryption settings.
		
	* The Bombe Machine:
		- Building on earlier Polish work, Turing designed an electromechanical device called the "Bombe".
		
		- How It Worked: The Bombe exploited a flaw in Enigma (a letter could never be encrypted as itself)
		to significantly reduce the number possible Enigma settings.
		
		- Impact: The intelligence gained from this work was vital to the Allied victory.

	 POST-WAR CONTRIBUTIONS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
	 * Early Electronic Computers: After the war, Turing contributed to early electronic computer development,
	such as the Manchester Mark I.
	
	* Artificial Intelligence (AI): His most famous post-war contribution was to the nascent field of artificial
	intelligence.
	
	* The Turing Test:
		- Proposal: In 1950, Turing proposed the Turing Test to determine wheter a machine could exhibit intelligent
		behavior indistinguishable from a human's.
		
		- Execution: A human interrogrator tries to distinguish between a human and a machine based on typed conversion.
		
		- Modern Application: A modern offshoot of this idea is CAPTCHA, used to differentiate humans from bots online.

	LEGACY
	* Death: Alan Turing died in 1954 at the age of 41.
	
	* Immense Contributions: His contributions to theorical computer science were monumental.
	
	* Turing Award: The highest honor in computer science - the Turing Award - is named after him, often considered
	the "Nobel Prize of Computing".
	
	* Foundation of the Digital Age: Turing's work laid the groundwork for the digital age we live in today.
