	INTRODUCTION TO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)
	* Computer Language vs. Natural Language:
		- Computer Language: Has a small vocabulary, follows very strict syntax and grammar rules, and requires high
		precision (e.g., programming languages).
		
		- Natural Language (Human Language): Has a large and diverse vocabulary, is often ambiguous, and vary by context
		and region.
		
	* Natural Language Processing (NLP):
		- An interdisciplinary field combining computer science and linguistics.
		
		- The goal is to equip computers with the alibity to understand, interept, and generate human language meaningfully.
		
		- NLP serves as a bridge between the complex world of human language and the logical world of computers.

	BASIC TECHNIQUES IN NLP
	* Syntax Parsing:
		- A process where NLP breaks down a sentence into smaller components so computers can process and understand the
		meaning.
		
		- Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifies the grammatical category of each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, adverb, 
		preposition).
		
		- Word Sense Disambiguous: The computer uses grammar and phrase structure rules to determine the correct meaning 
		of a word that has multiple senses.
		
		- Parse Tree: A tree structure representation that helps computers understand the grammatical structure of a
		sentence and the relationship between words/phrases.
		
	* Other Techniques:
		- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies and classifies named entities in text (e.g., names of people, places,
		organizations, dates).
		
		- Sentiment Analysis: Determines the attitude or emotion (positive, negative, neutral) expressed by the writer on 
		a given topic.
		
		- Text Summarization: Generates a concise and coherent summary from a long text.
		
		- Machine Translation: Translates text from one language to another.

	APPLICATIONS OF NLP IN DAILY LIFE
	* Voice Search:
		- Computers recognize users' questions and interactions via voice input.
		
		- Examples: "What's the weather today?", "Find nearby restaurants."
		
	* Voice Command Processing:
		- Allows users to control devices and perform tasks using voice.
		
		- Examples: "Set alarm for 7 AM", "Call Mom."
		
	* Natural Language Generation (NLG):
		- Computers automatically generate meaningful and coherent text from structured data.
		
		- Especially useful when data is stored in databases or on informational websites.
		
		- Examples: Generating financial reports, product descriptions, automated sports news.
		
		- Google's Knowledge Graph: Contains billions of facts and relationships between entities, helping Google understand
		the world more deeply and provide direct answer instead of just links.
		
	* Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:
		- Rule-based Chatbots: Early systems like ELIZA (from the 1960s) operated using hundreds of pre-defined rules 
		created by experts (e.g., ELIZA played the role of a therapist by reflecting keywords).
		
		- Modern Chatbots: Powered by machine learning, trained on large datasets of human conversations.
		
		- Applications: Customer service, user support, appointment booking.
		
		- Interesting experiment: Some chatbots even developed their own language in a Facebook experiment.

	SPEECH RECOGNITION AND SYNTHESIS
	* Speech Recognition:
		- The process of converting spoken language into text.
		
		- The field dates back decades, with the first speech recognition system developed in 1952.
		
		- Advancements: Thanks to breakthroughs in computing power and machine learning algorithms (especially deep 
		neural networks) real-time speech recognition has become far more feasible and accurate.
		
		- How it Works:
			+ Analyze audio signals using spectrograms to determine frequencies and phonemes (basic sound unit of a 
			language).
			
			+ Combines with language models containing statistical data about word sequences (e.g., which words commonly
			appear together) to improve accuracy and resolve ambiguity.
			
	* Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech TTS):
		- The process of converting written text into spoken voice.
		
		- How it Works: Breaks sentences into phonetic components and plays corresponding sounds.
		
		- Advancements: Older TTS systems had robotic and unnatural voices. Modern synthesized voices (e.g., Siri, Cortana, 
		Alexa) have greatly improved in terms of naturalness and expression, through the are still not fully human-like.

	FUTURE OF LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY AND CONCLUSION
	* Future of Voice Technology:
		- Rapid growth of voice user interfaces (VUI) on smartphones, cars, smart speakers, and other IoT devices.
		
		- Positive Feedback Loop: More usage generates more data for training systems, leading to better accuracy and 
		naturalness, which encourages even more use.
		
		- Many experts predict that voice technology will become as natural and common as screens and keyboards.
		
	* Conclusion:
		- NLP is a key field in AI that enables computers to overcome the barrier of complex human languages.
		
		- From sentence structure understanding to speech recognition and synthesis, NLP is transforming how we interact 
		with technology and access information.
		
		- With continuous advances in ML and Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP is expected to deliver even more
		groundbreaking innovations in the future.
