	FROM 2D GRAPHICS TO 3D
	* Introduction to 3D Graphics: In 3D graphics, points have three coordinates (x, y and z), adding a sense of depth.
	
	* 3D Projections:
		- Since the screen is 2D, 3D coordinates must be "flattened" onto 2D plane - this is called projection.
		
		- Orthographics Projecttion: In this type, parallel lines in 3D space remain parallel in the 2D projection. Commonly
		used in engineering drawings.
		
		- Perspective Projection: Mimics how we perceive depth in the real world, where parallel lines appear to converge in 
		the distance. Create a sense of depth and realism.

	CONSTRUCTING 3D MODELS: WIREFRAMES AND POLYGONS
	* Wireframes: Simple shapes can be defined using lines.
	
	* Polygons:
		- For more complex shapes, triangles (polygons) are preferred since three points uniquely defined a plane.
		
		- Polygon Mesh Density: The density of these polygon (mesh) affects both visual detail and computational load.
		
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	BASIC RENDERING ALGORITHMS
	* Scanline Rendering:
		- A classic algorithm for coloring polygons.
		
		- It works by iterating through horizontal lines (scanlines) and filling in pixels between polygon edges.
		
	* Anti-Aliasing (AA):
		- Smooths out jagged edges ("jaggies") in digital graphics.
		
		- Instead of pixels being simply on or off, their color adjusted based on how much of the pixel is covered 
		by the space.
		
	* Hidden Surface Removal:
		- In a 3D scene, some objects are hiden behinds others.
		
		- Painter's Algorithm: Sort polygons from farthest to nearest, then render them in that order. May struggled with 
		overlapping polygons.
		
		- Z-Buffering:
			+ Keep track of the closest object at each pixel. No sorting needed, making it faster.
			
			+ Maintains a "z-buffer" (depth buffer) and only draws a pixel if the new polygon is closer than what's already
			stored.
			
			+ Z-fighting: An artifact that occurs when two polygons have very similar depth values.
			
	* Back-Face Culling: An optimization technique where the back faces of polygons (those not visible to the camera) are not
	rendered, saving processing time.

	LIGHTING, SHADING, AND TEXTURING
	* Lighting / Shading:
		- Determines how light interacts with surfaces.
		
		- Flat Shading: The simplest method, where each polygon is given a single color based on it angle to the light and 
		viewer. This makes polygon boundaries more visible.
		
		- Advanced Techniques: Techniques like Gouraud and Phong shading provide smoother, and more realistic lighting.
		
	* Texturing:
		- Applying an image (texture) to the surface of a 3D model.
		
		- Texture Mapping: Involves mapping coordinates from the image to the pologon surface. When rendering the polygon,
		the color is looked up from the texture image.
		
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	HARDWARE ACCELERATION (GPU)
	* Computational Demands: Rendering complex 3D scenes requires significant computation.
	
	* Graphics Processing Units (GPUs):
		- Specialized processors designed to handle these calculations in parallel, greatly speeding up rendering.
		
		- They feature many processing cores and dedicated video memory (VRAM).
