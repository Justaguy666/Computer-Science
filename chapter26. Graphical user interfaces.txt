	INTRODUCTION TO GUI
	* The Macintosh Turning Point: The Apple Macintosh 1984 was the commercially successful personal computer
	with a GUI and mouse - marking a major shift from command-line interfaces.
	
	* Early Influences: Earlier interactive graphical applications like Sketchpad (1962) had a great influence, but Doughlas
	Engelbart is a key figure in developing the modern GUI.

	THE VISION OF DOUGHLAS ENGELBART
	* Augmenting Human Intellect: Engelbart believed computers could enhance human intellect to solve computer problems.
	
	* The oN-Line System (NLS) and the Mouse: He and his team developed the oN-Line System (NLS), and in 1964, created the
	first mouse along with Bill English.
	
	* "The Mother of All Demos": In 1968, Engelbart demonstrated NLS, showcasing features like bitmap graphics, video conferencing,
	word processing, real-time collaborative editing, the mouse, and multiple non-overlapping windows.

	XEROX PARC AND THE DESKTOP METAPHOR
	* Xerox PARC and Alto: Many from Engelbart's team moved to Xerox PARC, where the first true GUI-based computer, the Xerox Alto,
	was developed and completed in 1973.
	
	* The "Desktop Metaphor": Alto introduced the concept of the "desktop metaphor", making the screen resemble a physical
	desktop with overlapping windows, icons, menus, and a pointer (WIMP interface).
	
	* Widgets: It also included basic reusable graphical building blocks called widgets (buttons, checkboxes, sliders).
	
	* Event-Driven Programming: GUIs use event-driven programming, where code is executed in response to user actions (events)
	like clicks or keystrokes, rather than sequentially.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	XEROX STAR AND THE WYSIWYG Principle
	* Xerox Star (1981): Building on Alto, Xerox released the Star system in 1981, futher refining the desktop metaphor with
	file and folder icons and the concepts of "cut, copy, and paste", inspired by physical document editing.
	
	* WYSIWYG: It also introduced the principle of "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG).
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	STEVE JOBS, APPLE, AND MICROSOFT WINDOWS
	* Steve Jobs' Visit to Xerox PARC: In 1979, Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC and was deeply inspired by their GUI technology.
	
	* Apple Lisa and Macintosh:
		- Apple incorporated these ideas into the Apple Lisa (1983), which was expensive and commercially unsuccessful, and
		later the more affordable Macintosh (1984).
		
		- Initial Challenges: The early Macintosh struggled due to a lack of software.
		
	* Microsoft Windows:
		- Windows entered the GUI space with Windows 1.0. Although initially less polished than Mac OS, Windows - Especially version
		3.1 and the redesigned Windows 95 - gains significant market share.
		
		- Windows 95: Introduced features like preemtive multitasking and protected memory, along with enduring UI elements like 
		the Start menu and Windows Explorer.

	EVOLUTION AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
	* WIMP Model: Modern desktop GUIs largely evolved from the WIMP model pioneered by Xerox.
	
	* Engelbart's Vision: It emphasizes the ongoing effort to create more intuitive and powerful computing experiences, aligning
	with Engelbart's vision of augmenting human intellect.
