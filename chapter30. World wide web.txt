	THE APPLICATION LAYER IN THE OSI MODEL
	* Introduction:
		- In the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, the application layer is the top most layer, where software 
		applications interact directly with the network.
		
		- It provides network services to end-users and applications.
		
		- Protocols at this layer focus on specific user tasks, such as web browsing, email sending, and file transfers.
		
	* HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): The Foundation of the World Wide Web
		- Purpose: HTTP is the main protocol used to transmit information on the World Wide Web. It is the foundation
		for how browsers request and display web pages.
		
		- How It Works (Request-Response Model):
			+ When you enter an URL in your browser, it creates an HTTP Request.
			
			+ This request includes details like the web address, request method (GET to retrieve a page, POST to send data),
			and other info (headers).
			
			+ The request is sent to the corresponding Web Server.
			
			+ The server processes the request, locates the requested page (usually an HTML file), and returns an HTTP Response.
			
			+ This response includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK for success, 404 Not Found if the page doesn't exist) and the content
			of the web page.
			
			+ The browser receives the response, parses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and renders the page for you.
			
		- Statelessness: HTTP is stateless, meaning the server doesn't "remember" previous requests from the same browser.
		Each request is handled independently. Mechanisms like cookies are used to maintain state (e.g., shoping carts,
		login info).
		
	* HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure): Secure Communication
		- Purpose: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, using encryption to protect data transmitted between the browser and
		the server.
		
		- Mechanism: HTTPS uses encryption protocols like SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to create
		a secure communication channel.
		
		- Benefits:
			+ Encryption: Prevents eavesdroppers from accessing sentisive information (passwords, credit card numbers).
			
			+ Data Integrity: Ensures that data is not altered during transmission.
			
			+ Authentication: Helps verify that you're connecting to the legitimate server, not the fake one.
			
		- How to Recognize: HTTPS websites start with https:// and often show a padlock icon in the browser's address bar.

	THE WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW)
	* Introduction:
		- The World Wide Web (often shortened to "the Web") is a global information system accessible via the Internet.
			
		- It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN.
			
	* Key Components of the Web:
		- HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The markup language used to structure and present web content.
			
		- URL (Uniform Resource Locator): The unique address for each resource on the Web.
			
		- HTTP/HTTPS: The protocols for transmitting information.
			
		- Web Browser: The client application that allow users to view and interact with web pages (e.g., Chrome, Firefor).
			
		- Web Server: The program or machine that hosts web pages and responds to HTTP requests from browsers.

	EMAIL PROTOCOLS
	* SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Sending Email
		- Purpose: SMTP is the standard protocol for sending email between mail servers.
			
		- How It Works: When you send an email, your email client sends it to your provider's SMTP server, which then forwards
		it to the recipient's SMTP server.
			
	* POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3): Receiving Email (Download)
		- Purpose: POP3 is used to retrieve emails from the server to your local device.
			
		- How It Works: With POP3, emails are downloaded and usually deleted from the server afterward. You can only access
		the email from the device where it was downloaded.
			
	* IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): Receiving Email (Synchronization)
		- Purpose: IMAP allows you to access and manage emails directly on the server.
			
		- How It Works: Emails remain on the server. Any changes you make (read, delete, move emails) are synced with the 
		server, enabling access from multiple devices with consistent status.

	OTHER HIGHER LAYERS IN THE OSI MODEL
	* Session Layer:
		- Function: Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications on different machines.
		
		- Example: DNS lookup or web page requests typically occur within the context of a session.
		
	* Presentation Layer:
		- Function: Ensures data is presented in a format understandable by the Application Layer. It handles encoding/decoding,
		compression/decompression to maintain compatibility across systems.
		
		- Example: File format conversion (JPEG to PNG), character encoding (ASCII to Unicode).
		
	* Application Layer: Provides interfaces and services for end-users and applications.
