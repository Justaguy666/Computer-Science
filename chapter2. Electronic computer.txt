	GROWING NEED FOR COMPUTATION IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY
	* Societal Developments:
		- Rapid growth in global population.
		
		- Expansion of global trade networks.
		
		- Governments and businesses needed to process larger amount of data than ever before.
		
	* Early Computing Devices:
		- Mechanical devices like time-recording machines were used.
		
		- However, these had many limitations in terms of speed and accuracy.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	ELECTROMECHANICAL COMPUTERS
	* Havard Mark I:
		- One of the first electromachanical computers.
		
		- Very large, expensive, and prone to errors.
		
	* Relays:
		- Electrically controlled mechanical switches.
		
		- Used in electromachanical computers.
		
		- Limitation: Slow and unreliable.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	VACUUM TUBES
	* Invented by John Ambrose Fleming (1903):
		- The thermionic valve, or vacuum tube.
		
		- Enabled the control of electric current.
		
		- More reliable than relays.
		
	* Lee De Forest (1906):
		- Added a control grid to the vacuum tube.
		
		- Allowed navigation and amplification of electric signals.
		
	* Applications:
		- Become the foundation for radios, long-distance telephony, and other electronics.
		
		- Limitations: Fragile and expensive.
		
	* Colossus Mark 1:
		- First large-scale use of vacuum tubes in computing.
		
		- Used to decrypt German communications during WWII.
		
	* ENIAC - Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (1946):
		- The first general-purpose programmable electronic computer.
		
		- Completed at the University of Pennsylvania.

	TRANSISTOR (1947)
	* Invented at Bell Labs: Smaller, faster, and more reliable than vacuum tubes.
	
	* Impact: Led to the development of smaller, cheaper, and more powerful computers.
	
	* Modern appication: Widely used in many types of electronic devices.
