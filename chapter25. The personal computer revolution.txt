	THE EARLY DAYS AND COST BARRIERS
	* High Costs: For the first three decadeds of electronic computing, personal computers were impractical 
	due to their high costs.
	
	* Technological Advancements (early 1970s):
		- CPU: The emergence of compact, powerful, and affordable single-chip CPUs was a major catalyst.
		
		- IC, RAM, ROM: Advances in integrated circuits led to affordable RAM and ROM.
		
		- Storage: Reliable and low-cost storage like magnetic taps and floppy disks became available.
		
		- Display: Inexpensive displays, often modified televisions, completed the necessary components.
		
	* The Rise of Microcomputers: The combination of these cheaper components led to the creation of "microcomputers",
	so named for their small size compared to existing systems. More importantly, they became affordable for individuals.

	PIONEERING PERSONAL COMPUTERS
	* Altair 8800 (1975):
		- Widely considered the first commercially successful personal computer, the Altair 8800 was sold as a 
		built-it-yourself kit.
		
		- Its popularity sparked the creation of add-ons and a community of enthusiasts.
		
	* The Birth of Microsoft: Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800, making
	it more user-friendly. This became the first product of their newly formed company, Microsoft.
	
	* Homebrew Computer Club & Apple:
		- This influential club was a hub for computer enthusiasts. Steve Wozniak, inspired by the Altair 8800,
		designed his own computer.
		
		- Apple I (1976): Wozniak, together with Steve Jobs, decided to sell assembled circuit boards. Users still
		needed to supply their own keyboard, power supply, and case. This was the first production of Apple Computer.
		
	* The "Trinity" of 1977: Three game-changing computers were released:
		- Apple II: Apple's first fully assembled systems, featuring color graphics and sound output, became a 
		massive success.
		
		- TRS-80 Model 1: A more affordable, less advanced option sold by Radio Shack.
		
		- Commodore PET 2001: With an all-in-one design, it blurred the line between computers and appliances.
		
		- These machines came with BASIC interpreters, fueling a consumer software industry including games and 
		productivity tools like VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program.

	IBM ENTERS THE MARKET AND OPEN ARCHITECTURES
	* IBM Joins the Game: IBM, seeing its market share decline dur to microcomputers, decided to enter the
	personal computing space.
	
	* IBM PC (1981): Developed by a small, independent team, the IBM PC used off-the-shelf components (like Intel
	chips and Microsoft's DOS) to keep costs low. It was an instant success, especially among businesses.
	
	* Open Architecture: IBM's PC open architecture, with thorough documentation, allowed third-party companies to create
	compatible hardware and peripherals, driving innovation and a large ecosystem. This led to "IBM-compatible" machines.
	
	* The Rise of IBM-Compatible Computers and Microsoft's Dominance: Companies like Compaq and Dell began selling
	their own IBM PC clones, often running Microsoft's MS-DOS, which quickly became the most popular PC operating sytem.

	APPLE'S ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY AND THE THE MAC VS. PC WAR
	* Apple's Closed Architecture: Apple maintained a significant market share by taking the opposite approach: a closed
	architecture with proprietary designs. This allowed Apple to control the entire user experience, from hardware 
	to software.
	
	* The "Mac vs. PC" War: This philosophical divide (open vs. closed architecture) formed the basis of an going 
	rivalry between Macs and PCs.
	
	* Apple Macintosh (1984): To compete with affordable PCs, Apple released the Macintosh - an all-in-one computer
	with a revolutionary graphical user interface instead of a text-based command line.
