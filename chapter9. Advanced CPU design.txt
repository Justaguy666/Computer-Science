	EARLY METHODS FOR ENCHANCING CPU PERFORMANCE
	* Improving Transistor Switching Speed: Initially, the simplest way to make CPUs faster was to increase the
	switching speed (on/off) of transistors. This was achieved through transistor miniaturization and material
	improvements.
	
	* Specialized and More Complex Instruction Sets:
		- Modern CPUs have dedicated circuits for specific tasks such as graphics processing, video decoding,
		and data encryption/decryption.
		
		- This has led to larger and more complex instruction sets, allowing CPUs to perform these tasks more
		efficiently.

	OVERCOMING THE RAM BOTTLENECK: CACHE MEMORY
	* RAM Bottleneck: As CPUs became faster, accessing data from the main RAM becam a major bottleneck.
	RAM is significantly slower than the CPU due to physical distance and latency.
	
	* Cache Memory:
		- Definition: A small, extremely fast memory located directly on the CPU chip.
		
		- How It Works:
			+ When the CPU requests data, a block of related data (not just the requested piece) is loaded
			into from RAM into the cache.
			
			+ Cache Hit: If the CPU finds the needed data in the cache, access is very fast.
			
			+ Cache Miss: If the data isn't in the cache, the CPU must wait for it to load from RAM, after which
			it's stored in the cache for future access.
			
			+ Dirty Bit: A bit used to track whether data in the cache has been modified. If so, it must be written
			back to RAM before being replaced.
			
		- Cache Levels: Modern CPUs usually feature multiple cache levels (L1, L2, L3) - L1 being the smallest and
		fastest, L3 the largest and slowest.

	BOSTING PERFORMANCE THROUGH INSTRUCTION-LEVEL PARALLELISM
	* Instruction Pipelining:
		- Concept: Break the instruction execution process into multiple stages (e.g., fetch, decode, execute) and 
		overlap them like an assembly line.
		
		- Benefits: Increases the number of instructions completed per clock cycle (IPC), through it may not shorten
		the time to complete a single instruction.
		
		- Challenges:
			+ Data Dependencies: Occur when an instruction needs the result of a previous instruction that hasn't completed,
			potentially causing pipeline stalls.
			
			+ Out-of-Order Execution: Advanced CPUs can reorder instruction (if there are no dependencies) to reduce stalls.
			
	* Branch Prediction and Speculative Execution:
		- Problem: Conditional branch instructions disrupt the pipeline because the CPU doesn't know which path will
		be taken.
		
		- Speculative Execution: The CPU predicts the path and begins fetching and executing instructions accordingly.
		
		- Branch Prediction: Complex algorithms improve prediction accuracy (often > 90%).
		
		- Misprediction Handling: If the prediction is wrong, the pipeline must be flushed and corrected instructions
		reloaded, wasting time.
		
	* Superscalar Processors:
		- Concept: These processors have multiple execution units (e.g., several ALUs), allowing them to execute more
		than one instruction per clock cycle.
		
		- Benefit: Significantly increases IPC.

	EXPANDING PROCESSING POWER: MULTI-CORE AND MULTI-CPU
	* Multi-Core Processors:
		- Concept: Modern CPUs often contain multiple independent processing units (cores) on a single chip.
		
		- Benefit: Enables the execution of multiple instruction streams in parallel - ideal for applications
		that can be divided into independent tasks.
		
	* Multi-CPU Systems and Supercomputers:
		- Multi-CPU Systems: To achieve even greater processing power, computer systems can use multiple physcial
		CPUs.
		
		- Supercomputers: Masive computer systems housing tens of thousands of CPUs with millions of cores, capable
		of performing quadrillions of calculations per second. Used for intensive computations such as climate modeling,
		scientific research, and complex simulation.
