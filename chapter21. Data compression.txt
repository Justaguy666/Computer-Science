	THE NEED FOR DATA COMPRESSION
	* File Size Issue: Large files take up more storage space and require more time to transmit (e.g, downloading
	email attachments).
	
	* Purpose of Compression:
		- Reduce file size to save storage space.
		
		- Speed up data transmission over networks.

	LOSSLESS COMPRESSION
	* Definition:
		- This type of compression reduces file size without losing any data.
		
		- When decompressed, the file is exactly the same as the original.
		
	* Common Techniques:
		- Run-Length Encoding (RLE):
			+ Principle: Works well with data that has repeated values, such as images with large areas of the
			same color.
			
			+ How It Works: Instead of storing each pixel individually, it stores the value and how many times 
			it repeats.
			
			+ Example: In a Pac-Man image, 7 consecutive yellow pixels can be stored as "7 yellow" instead of
			"yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow".
			
		- Dictionary Coding (using Huffman Trees):
			+ Principle: Replaces frequently occuring blocks of data with shorter codes. A dictionary is built
			where common blocks are assigned shorter codes.
			
			+ Assigning Codes: The trees is then used to assign codes, with more common blocks getting shorter 
			codes (e.g., "yellow yellow" becomes "0").
			
			+ Dictionary Storage: The dictionary must be stored along with the compressed data.
			
	* File Format Examples: GIF, PNG, PDF, ZIP.

	LOSSY COMPRESSION
	* Definition:
		- This types removes some information, often data humans are less likely to notice.
		
		- It allows for significantly smaller file sizes.
		
	* Perceptual Coding:
		- Main Idea: Exploits how human perception works (e.g., sounds we can't hear well or subtle color changes
		we don't notice).
		
	* Applications in File Types:
		- Audio Compression (e.g., MP3):
			+ Hearing Limitation: Humans don't hear all frequencies equally well (e.g., ultrasound).
			
			+ Removing Data: Lossy audio compression removes data in frequencies that are hard for us to hear,
			like very high or deep bass sounds.
			
			+ Example: This is why phone calls sound different from live voices - the audio has been compressed.
			
			+ Efficiency: MP3 files can be around 10 times smaller than uncompressed audio.
			
		- Image Compression (e.g., JPEG):
			+ Vision Limitations: Our vision is good at detecting sharp contrasts (edges) but not subtle color 
			differences.
			
			+ How It Works: JPEG splits images into blocks (e.g., 8x8 pixels) and remove high-frequency spatial
			data (fine details) that we're unlikely to notice.
			
			+ Efficiency: This greatly reduces file size while preserving the overall image.
			
		- Video Compression (e.g., MP4):
			+ Video is a sequence of images (a series of frames).
			
			+ Temporal Redundancy: Many pixels stay the same between frames (like the background). Instead of 
			re-sending them, video can copy them from the earlier frames.
			
			+ Motion Compensation: Tracks moving objects (e.g., a waving hand), defines a "region", and sends 
			instruction of how it moves (shift, rotate) rather than sending all pixel data for each frame. You're
			essentially seeing a reused hand from a previous moment.
			
			+ Efficiency: MP4 files can be 20 to 200 times smaller than raw video.
			
			+ Drawback: Overcompression can lead to noticeable artifacts when algorithms try to predict motion
			with too little data.

	IMPORTANCE OF COMPRESSION
	* Compression is for effiently storing and sharing images, music, and videos.

	* Without compression, streaming and data transmission would be extremely difficult and expensive.
