	DEFINITION AND HISTORY OF ROBOTS
	* What is a Robot?
		- Robots are machines capable of performing a series of automated actions, controlled by computers.
		
		- They come in various shapes and sizes:
			+ Industrial arms: Widely used in manufacturing plants.
			
			+ Self-driving cars: Autonomous vehicles.
			
			+ Drones: Remotely or autonomously operated flying devices.
			
			+ Humanoid robots: Robots designed to resemble humans.
			
	* Origin of the term "Robot":
		- The word "robot" was first used in a play by Czech writer Karel Capek in 1920, titled "R.U.R (Rossum's 
		Universal Robots)".
		
		- It derives from Czech word "robota", meaning "forced labor" or "drudgery".
		
	* Early History of Automatons:
		- Before computer-controlled robots existed, many ancient and medieval inventors created mechanical devices that
		performed tasks automatically. These were known as automatons.
		
		- Example:
			+ A mechanical duck that ate grain, created by Jacques de Vaucanson (1739).
			
			+ The "Turk", a chess-playing machine by Wolfgang von Kempelen (1770).
			
	* Emergence of Computer-controlled Robots:
		- The first computer-controlled machines appeared in the late 1940s and were known as CNC (Computer Numerical
		Control) machines.
		
		- These could execute programmed instructions to perform precise tasks in manufacturing.
		
	* First Commercial Deployment:
		- The first programmable industrial robot, named Unimate, was sold to General Motors in 1960.
		
		- Unimate was used to lift hot metal parts from die casting machines, replacing dangerous human labor.

	HOW ROBOTS ARE CONTROLLED
	* Feedback Control Loop:
		- This is the basic principle that allows a robot to move to a specific position or perform an accurate action.
		
		- It involves four main components:
			+ Sensors: Measure the current state of the robot or environment (e.g., position, speed, temperature).
			
			+ Error Calculation: Compares the sensor-measured value to the desired value (target) to compute the "error".
			
			+ Controller: Uses the error to compute the necessary action to reduce it.
			
			+ Actuators: Carry out the physical action in the real world (e.g., motors that move the robot arm).
			
		- This process repeats continuously until the robot reaches the target.
		
	* PID Controller (Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller):
		- One of the most common and effective feedback controllers, widely used to smoothly and precisely control robots 
		while handling external forces and disturbances.
		
		- A PID controller computes three values to determine control actions:
			+ Proportional (P): Based on the current error. The larger the error, the stronger the response.
			
			+ Integral (I): Accumulates past errors over time. Helps eliminate steady-state errors and stablizes the 
			system over longer-term changes.
			
			+ Derivate (D): Based on the rate of change of the error. Helps predict future error and prevent overshooting,
			resulting in smoother motion.
			
	* High-level Software:
		- In addition to low-level control loops, robots also use high-level software responsible for planning and 
		executing complex tasks.
		
		- Examples: Drawing optimal paths, breaking down larger tasks into simpler movements, making decisions based on
		complex sensor input (e.g., computer vision).

	ACHIEVEMENTS, CHALLENGES, AND APPLICATIONS OF ROBOTS
	* Achievements:
		- Robots have achieved remarkable feats in environments that are harsh or dangerous for humans.
		
		- Examples: Deep ocean exploration, Mars exploration (e.g., Curiosity, Perseverance rovers).
		
	* Challenges:
		- Many tasks that seem simple for humans are extremely difficult for robots.
		
		- Examples:
			+ Bipedal locomotion: Requires complex balance and control.
			
			+ Grasping objects without damaging them: Requires fine force sensing and dexterity.
			
			+ Operating in unknown, dynamic environments: Difficult to make flexible decisions like humans.
			
	* Applications of Robots:
		- Self-driving cars:
			+ One of the largest and fastest-growing applications of robotics.
			
			+ Rely on a combination of sensors (radar, lidar, cameras) and computer vision algorithms to navigate 
			traffic and avoid obstacles.
			
		- Military robots:
			+ The military is interested in robots because they can surpass human in strength, endurance, attention, and
			accuracy in danerous missions.
			
			+ Examples: Bomb disposal robots, reconnaissance and combat drones.
			
	* The Dual Nature of Robotic Technology:
		- Like many powerful technologies, robotics has a dual nature.
		
		- It can be used for good (rescue, healthcare, efficient manufacturing) or for harm (autonomous weapons, surveillance
		that violates privacy).
		
		- The use of lethal autonomous weapons raises complex ethical and legal issues.
		
		- It's crucial to carefully consider their potential and dangers to ensure responsible development and deployment.
