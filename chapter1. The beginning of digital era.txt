	THE IMPORTANCEC AND UBIQUITY OF COMPUTERS
	* Why are Computers so Important?
		- "The lifeblood of the modern world": Imagine a day without computers - everything from electricity,
		water, transportation, to finance and healthcare could come to a halt.
		
		- Automation: Robots in factories, self-driving cars, warehouse management systems.
		
		- Advance medicine: Imaging devices (MRI, CT), robot surgery, drug research.
		
		- Global communication: Internet, social media, smartphones - connecting people everywhere.
		
		- Entertainment: Video games, movies, digital music.
		
		- Scientific research: Climate modeling, space exploration, big data analysis.
		
	* A Revolutionary Transformation:
		- Just as the Industrial Revolution changed how we produce, the Information Technology Revolution is
		reshaping how we live, work, and interact.
		
		- From a specialized tool, the computer has become an indispensable part of every aspect of life.

	THE BASIC NATURE OF A COMPUTER
	* Simple yet Powerful:
		- Although they may appear complex, as its core, a computer is a very simple machine.
		
		- It performs only basic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, comparision) at extremely high speeds.
		
		- "Multiple layers of abstraction": The complexity we perceive results from the combination of countless
		simple operations layered through programming and design. Imagine a giant jigsaw puzzle made from millions
		of tiny pieces.
		
	* Data and Information:
		- Computers process data (typically in the form of 0s and 1s).
		
		- Once processed, the data becomes meaningful information for humans.
		
		- Example: Input 2 + 2 into the computer (data) -> The computer processes -> Output 4 (information).

	EARLY HISTORY OF COMPUTER
	* Early Calculation Tools:
		- Abacus (around 2500 BC):
			+ Purpose: Assist with basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction).
			
			+ How it works: Uses movable beads on rods to represent numbers and operations.
			
			+ Significance: One of the earliest "numeric" calculation tools, showing that the need for computation
			is ancient.
			
		- The Move Toward Mechanization - Step Reckoner (Gottfried Leibniz - 1694): 
			+ Purpose: Automatically perform four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
			division).
				
			+ Significance: The first mechanical digital calculator capable of multiplication and division,
			laying the foundation for more complex machines.
				
	* Charles Babbage and the Concept of a General-Purpose Computer:
		- "The father of computing": Charles Babbage was a British mathematician and inventor.
		
		- Difference Engine (1820s):
			+ Purpose: Automatically compute mathematical tables (e.g., logarithmic tables) using the method
			of finite differences.
			
			+ Design: A large, complex mechanical device with thousands of parts.
			
			+ Reality: Never fully completed during Babbage's lifetime due to complexity and cost.
			
		- Analytical Engine (1830s):
			+ Purpose: The first design of a general-purpose, programmable computer.
			
			+ Main components (similar to modern computers):
				+ "Store" (Memory): For storing data and intermediate results.
				
				+ "Mill" (Processor): For performing logic and arithmetic operations.
				
				+ Input/Output: Used punched cards to input programs and data, and printed results to paper.
				
			+ Significance: A revolutionary design containing most core concepts of modern computers - decades
			ahead of its time.
			
	* Ada Lovelace - the First Programmer:
		- Daughter of Lord Byron: A British mathematician and writer.
		
		- Role: Studied the Analytical Engine in depth and realized that it could manipulate not only numbers but
		also symbols and logic.
		
		- Sample program: She wrote detailed notes and algorithms (hypothetical programs) for the Analytical Engine
		to calculate Bernoulli numbers.
		
		- Significance: Recognized as the first programmer in history, introducing the idea of software.
		
	* Practical Applications and the Dawn of the Modern Computing Era:
		- Herman Hollerith and the Tabulating Machine (1880s):
			+ Background : The U.S government struggled to process the 1880 census, taking over 7 years manually.
			
			+ Solution: Herhollerith developed an electromechanical machine using punched cards to store and 
			process data.
			
			+ Result: The 1890 census was processed in just few months, saving millions of dollars.
			
			+ Significance: Demonstrated the vast potential of large-scale data processing automation.
			
		- The Birth of IBM:
			+ Hollerith's company (Tabulating Machine Company) later merged with others to form the International
			Business Machines Corporation (IBM) - one the world's largest tech corporations.
			
			+ Significance: Marked the beginning of the commercial computer industry.

	THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL COMPUTERS
	* Rising Demands: The population boom and global commerce in the early 20th century demanded faster, more flexible,
	and more reliable data processing tools than mechanical or electromechanical mechines.
	
	* Foundation Laid: Earlier developments provided a solid foundation for the rise of digital computers, which
	would completely revolutionize human computing capabilities.
