	INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
	* Machine Learning (ML):
		- A subset of artificial intelligence (AI).
		
		- Comprises algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without being explicity programmed.
		
		- Once trained, these algorithms can make predictions or decisions based on new data.
		
		- Common applications: Email spam filtering, recommendation system (videos, products), weather forecasting,
		medical diagnosis.
		
	* Artificial Intelligence (AI):
		- A broader field aiming to create machines capable of cognitive functions like humans (e.g., learning, 
		problem-solving, pattern recognition, language comprehension).
		
		- ML is one of the key techniques used to achieve AI goals.

	HOW MACHINE LEARNING LEARNS AND CLASSIFIES
	* Classification:
		- A common ML task where an algorithm learns to assign labels or categories to new data based on learned patterns.
		
		- Algorithms used for this are called classifiers.
		
		- Example: Classifying Luna moths vs Emperor moths based on features.
		
	* The Learning Process:
		- Training data: A labeled dataset (e.g., Luna or Emperor moth) collected and annotated by humans (e.g., entomologists).
		
		- Features: Attributes or variables of the data used to train the model (e.g., wingspan, weigth of the moth).
		
		- Data Visualization: Data can be plotted (e.g., scatter plots) to see relationships between features and class 
		distribution.
		
		- Decision Boundaries: ML algorithms aim to find optimal lines or planes that seperate data classes in 
		feature space.
		
		- Confusion Matrix: A table used to evaluate the performance of a classifier by showing correct and incorrect
		predictions per class.
		
		- Goal: Maximize correct classifications and minimized errors (e.g., misclassifications).
		
		- Prediction: After training, the model uses learned decision boundaries to predict labels for unseen data.

	COMMON MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES
	* Supevised Learning:
		- The most widely used ML type, where models are trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).
		
		- Includes classification (like the moth example) and regression (predicting continous values, e.g., house prices).
		
	* Supevised Learning Algorithms:
		- Decision Trees:
			+ Simple, intuitive method that splits the decision space into "boxes" or regions based on yes/no questions
			about features.
			
			+ Represented as a tree diagram or code. The algorithm chooses optimal features and thresholds for splitting.
			
		- Random Forests:
			+ An advanced technique using multiple independent decision trees (a "forest") and combining their results
			for final prediction.
			
			+ Helps reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.
			
		- Support Vector Machines (SVM):
			+ Find the optimal hyperplane to seperate data classes in feature space.
			
			+ Can use curved boundaries (not limited to straight lines) for complex data.
			
	* Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):
		- Inspired by the structure and function of neurons in the human brain.
		
		- Structure: Composed of artificial neurons organized into layers.
			+ Input Layer: Receives raw data.
			
			+ Hidden Layer: Perform complex computations.
			
			+ Output Layer: Produces the final prediction.
			
		- Neuron Function: Each neuron takes multiple inputs, multiples them by weigths, adds a bias, and applies an
		activation function to produce an output signal.
		
		- Training: Weights and biases are iteratively adjusted through training (using the backpropagation algorithm) to
		optimize model performance.
		
		- Deep Learning: A branch of ML using neural networks with many hidden layers (deep neural networks)
			+ Made practical by powerful processors (especially GPUs) and massive data availability.
			
			+ Applications: Face recognition, self-driving cars, speech translation, medical diagnosis, natural 
			language processing (NLP).

	TYPES OF AI AND THE FUTURE
	* Types of AI:
		- Narrow AI / Weak AI:
			+ Intelligent only in specific and limited tasks.
			
			+ Examples: Moth classification system, virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommender systems, chess-playing
			software.
			
			+ Most current AI applications fall into this category.
			
		- Strong AI / General AI (GAI):
			+ Possesses comprehensive intelligence like a human across all cognitive domains.
			
			+ Can learn, understand, and apply knowledge to solve problems in diverse contexts.
			
			+ Still a research goal, not yet achieved.
			
		- Superintelligence (ASI): Hypothetical intelligence far surpassing human capabilities in all areas.
		
	* Reinforcement Learning (RL):
		- A powerful ML approach where an agent learns decision-making via trial and error in an environment.
		
		- The agent receives rewards for correct actions and penalties for wrong ones, grandually discovering optimal strategies.
		
		- Example: Google's AlphaGo used RL to learn and defeat top Go players in the world.
		
	* The Future of AI:
		- The explosion of digital knowledge and big data provides ideal resources for training powerful AI models.
		
		- AI can learn and process information much faster than humans.
		
		- Systems like IBM Watsom can gather and synthesize knowledge from millions of sources to answer complex questions.
		
		- AI is expected to profoundly impact all areas of human life - from healthcare and education to industry and society.
