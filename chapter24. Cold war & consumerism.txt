	EARLY INFLUENCES AND COMMERCIALIZATION
	* Influence of the Cold War and the Space Race: the Cold War and the Space Race significantly increased
	government spending on science and engineering, including computer development.
	
	* Pioneering Projects: Projects like ENIAC, EDVAC, and Colossus - initially driven by wartime needs - laid
	the groundwork for the future advancements.
	
	* Commercialization and Public Awareness:
		- UNIVAC I: The first commercially success computer, marking a major shift.
		
		- Election Prediction: UNIVAC I's used in predicting the 1952 U.S. presidential election brought computing
		to public attention.

	VISIONARY IDEAS AND THE RISE OF THE TRANSISTOR
	* Vannevar Bush's "Memex" Concept:
		- A hypothetical personal information storage and retrieval device, highly influential.
		
		- He also predicted interconnected encyclopedias, foreshadowing the concept of hyperlinking.
		
	* Bush's Role in the NSF: Bush was instrumental in founding the Nation Science Foundation (NSF), a key sponsor of American scientific
	research.
	
	* Rise of the Transistor and Japanese Innovation:
		- Consumer Electronics: The 1950s saw the emergence of consumer electronics based on transistors, such
		as portable radios.
		
		- Japan and Semiconductor Technology: Seeking postwar economic growth, Japan licensed transistor technology
		and quickly became a major manufacturer in the semiconductor and electronics industries.
		
		- Sony TR-55; Sony's TR-55 transistor radio was an early notable success.

	THE SPACE RACE AND THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (IC)
	* Sputnik and NASA: The Soviet Union's early space success pushed the U.S. to heavily invest in NASA.
	
	* Apollo Computer Needs: The Apollo program required fast, small, lightweight, and reliable computers.
	
	* IC Development: This led to the development and use of integrated circuits in the Apollo Guidance Computer,
	the first computer to use them.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	MILITARY, SUPERCOMPUTERS, AND GLOBAL POWER SHIFTS
	* Military Applications: Military uses, particularly nuclear missile systems, continued to drive mass production
	of ICs.
	
	* Supercomputers: The U.S. government also invested in powerful "supercomputers" from companies like CDC, Cray, 
	and IBM.
	
	* Power Shift:
		- Japan's Focus on Consumer Markets: While early U.S. semiconductor industry growth was fuele by government
		contracts, Japanese companies focused on low-margin consumer markets and invested heavily in manufactoring efficency.
		
		- Competition and Outsourcing: As Cold War spending declined, American electronics firms struggled to compete
		with Japanese companies like Hitachi. Many downsized or outsouced production.

	COMSUMER ELECTRONICS BOOM AND THE DAWN OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER
	* Pocket Calculators: Japanese firms like Sharp and Casio dominated the 1970s pocket calculator market by
	using ICs to make them affordable to general public.
	
	* Microprocessors and the Intel 4004: This drove the development of microprocessors, such as Intel's 4004
	(originally commissioned by a Japanese calculator company).
	
	* Rise of Japanese Electronics: This era saw Japan rises in electronics such as TV, VCRs, digital watchers,
	and the Walkman.
	
	* First Personal Computers: Affordable microprocessors led to new products like video games (Pong) and early 
	home computers (Altair 8800) and game consoles (Atari 2600).
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	TWO DRIVING FORCES OF PROGRESS
	* Dual Motivation: Rapid advancement was driven by both government funding (enabling early adoption of new
	technologies) and consumer demand (making technology commercially vitable and reducing costs).
	
	* Continuing to This Day: This dual dynamic continues to shape technological development today.
