	INTRODUCTION TO THE CPU
	* Definition: The CPU (Central Processing Unit), often reffered to as the brain of the computer, is responsible
	for executing all instructions in a computer program, processing data, and coordinating the actions of other
	components.
	
	* Core Roles:
		- Executes software programs.
		
		- Perform arithmetic and logic operations.
		
		- Coordinate the operations of the entire computer system.
		
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	KEY COMPONENTS OF THE CPU
	* Registers:
		- Definition: Small, extremely fast memory unit located inside the CPU.
		
		- Function: Temporarily store data and instructions that the CPU is currently processing or about
		the process.
		
		- Advantage: Much faster access speed than RAM.
		
		- Important Type of Registers:
			+ Instruction Register (IR): Stores the current instruction being executing by the CPU.
			
			+ Instruction Address Register (IAR) / Program Counter (PC): Holds the memory address of the next
			instruction to be fetched.
			
			+ Data Registers: Temporarily store data.
			
	* Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): This component performs all arithmetic and logic operations.
	
	* Control Unit (CU):
		- Definition: Manages and coordinates all operations inside the CPU and between the CPU and other
		computer components.
		
		- Functions:
			+ Decode instruction.
			
			+ Generate control signals for other components (ALU, registers, memory).
			
			+ Control data flow.
			
	* Random Access Memory (RAM):
		- Although not part of the CPU, RAM is the main memory the CPU directly interacts with to fetch 
		programs and data.
		
		- RAM stores running programs and data for quick CPU access.
		
	* Clock:
		- Definition: An electrical circuit that generates regular pulses to synchronize all CPU activities.
		
		- Speed: Measured in Hertz (Hz), Kilohertz (KHz), Megahertz (MHz), Gigahertz (GHz). A higher clock
		speed means the CPU can execute more instructions per second.
		
		- Overclocking: Increasing the CPU clock speed beyond its default limit to gain higher performance.
		May lead to overheating and instability.
		
		- Dynamic Frequency Scaling: The CPU automatically adjust its clock speed to save energy when performance
		is not needed, or to boost speed when processing demands are high.

	THE CPU INSTRUCTION EXECUTION CYCLE (FETCH - DECODE - EXECUTE)
	* Fetch Stage:
		- The CPU uses the address from the IAR/PC to fetch the next instruction from RAM.
			
		- The instruction is stored in the IR.
			
		- The IAR/PC is then updated to point to the next instruction.
			
	* Decode Stage:
		- The CU analyze the fetched instruction in the IR.
			
		- It determines the instruction type (e.g., ADD, LOAD, STORE) and its operands (data or memory 
		addresses).
			
		- The CU generates appropriate control signals to prepare for execution.
			
	* Execute Stage: Based on CU control signals, the ALU or other parts of the CPU perform the operations specified
	by the instruction.
	
	* Repeat the Cycle: After one instruction is executed, the CPU goes back to the fetch stage to get the next
	instruction, and the cycle continues until the program ends.
	
	* While mordern CPUs are far more complex, the fundamental principles of the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle and the roles
	of main components remain the same.
