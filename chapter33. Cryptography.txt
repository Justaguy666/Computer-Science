	INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DEFENSE IN DEPTH
	* Defense in Depth:
		- A security strategy where multiple layers of defense mechanisms are implemented to protect systems and data.
		
		- Similar to how castles were built with multiple defensive layers (walls, moats, gates) to discourage attackers.
		
		- The goal is that if one layer is breached, others still exist to stop or slow the attack.
		
	* Cryptography:
		- From Greek: "kryptos" (secret) and "graphein" (to write).
		
		- A branch of computer science focused on securing information and communication through the use of codes (ciphers).
		
		- Main goals: ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data.
		
		- Encryption: The process of converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext.
		
		- Decryption: The reverse process of converting ciphertext back to readable plaintext.

	CLASSICAL AND HISTORICAL ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES
	* Substitution Ciphers:
		- Each character in the original message is replaced with another character based on a fixed rule.
		
		- Example: Caesar Cipher: Each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet (e.g., shift 3:
		A becomes D, B becomes E).
		
	* Transposition Ciphers:
		- Rearranges the order of characters in the message without changing the characters themselves.
		
		- Example: Columnar Transposition Cipher: Message is written in rows and read in columns according to a key order.
		
	* Enigma Machine:
		- A famous encryption device used by Nazi Germany during WWII.
		
		- Used multiple rotors and a plugboard to create complex and constantly changing substitution mappings.
		
		- Its complex made decryption extremely difficult at the time, but it was eventually broken by Allied cryptographers.

	SYMMETRIC AND ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY
	* Symmetric Cryptography:
		- Also known as secret-key cryptography.
		
		- Both sender and receiver use the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt messages.
		
		- Advantages: Faster encryption/decryption.
		
		- Disadvantages: Key distribution problem (how to share the secret key safely over an insecure channel?).
		
		- Popular Algorithms:
			+ Data Encryption Standard (DES): Developed in 1977 using a 56-bit key. Became insecure by 1999 due to advances
			in computing power.
			
			+ Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): Finalized in 2001 with much larger key sizes (128, 192, or 256 bits), 
			making brute-force attacks impractical. AES balances performance and security and is widely used as the strongest
			standard today.
			
	* Asymmetric Cryptography:
		- Also known as public-key cryptography.
		
		- Uses two mathematically related keys: a public key and a private key.
		
		- The public key can be shared openly and is used to encrypted messages. Only the private key can decrypt them.
		
		- Conversely, messages encrypted with a private key can be decrypted by the public key. This is used for digital
		signatures to verify authenticity and integrity.
		
		- Advantages: Solves the key distribution issue of symmetric cryptography.
		
		- Disadvantages: Slower encryption/decryption.
		
		- Popular Algorithms:
			+ Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: Allows two parties to agree on a shared secret key over an insecure channel 
			using one-way functions.
			
			+ RSA: The most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure data transmission, digital signatures,
			and key exchange.

	APPLICATIONS OF MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY
	* Securing Online Communication (e.g., HTTPS): When you connect to a secure website (https://), a complex process
	involving both symmetric and asymmetric encryption happens:
		- Server authentication (Asymmetric): Your browser uses the server's public key to verify its identity (via 
		digital certificates).
		
		- Key exchange (Asymmetric - Diffie-Hellman or RSA): Browser and server establish a temporary session key without
		sending it directly.
		
		- Communication encryption (Symmetric - AES): Once the session key is established, all data is encrypted using 
		fast symmetric algorithms (e.g., AES).
		
	* Digital Signatures: Uses asymmetric encryption to ensure the authenticity (who sent it) and integrity (data not
	altered) of electronic documents.
	
	* Cryptocurrencies: Currencies like Bitcoin use cryptographic techniques (especially hashing and digital signatures) to
	secure transactions and control the creation of new units.
	
	* VPN (Virtual Private Network): Uses cryptography to create a secure "tunnel" that encrypts data when connecting to the 
	Internet, protecting your privacy and security, especially on public Wi-Fi.
